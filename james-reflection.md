#Reflections

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with understanding git and github workflow. How often do I have to commit? What is push? What is fetch? What's the difference between a push and a pull request. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

All the concepts I mentioned above were clarified during the GPS!

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked when I should be adding and committing. What is push? What is fetch? What's the difference between a push and a pull request?

* What still confuses you about Git? 

When should I merge a feature branch into the master and when should I merge the master into the feature branch?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Well, no one signed up so I was solo. It was a fantastic experience!
